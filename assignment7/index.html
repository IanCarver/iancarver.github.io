          <p> The objective
            of this resume is to fufil a requirement for my AME 220 course at ASU.
            Some education that isn't particularly relevent has been added, the
            contact info is not correct (except for the email address), and additional
            skills/experience has been left off for brevity.</p>

              Sunshine Foam Company - Production Assistant:
              I worked at a Foam manufacturing plant for several months in 2014
              as a summer job. My duties included running several smaller
              machines that sealed open-celled foam, running a die-cutter, and
              packaging smaller deliveries. I also helped to re-organize the
              shipping an recieving section of the warehouse.

              Jimmy John's - Bike Delivery and In-Shop Worker:
              I worked for 1.5 years starting in August of 2016 when I started
              attending ASU. My duties included delivering orders on bicycle,
              running the register, taking phone-orders, and cleaning.

              Education at Work - Venmo Customer Support:
              I worked for EAW on behalf of Venmo for 6 months starting in
              December of 2017. I did email support and the majority of the
              tickets I would recive would concern MFA issues, adding bank
              accounts, and the status of delayed payments.
            </li>

              Education at Work - Discover Cell Miner:
              I worked for EAW on behalf of Discover for 3 months starting in
              June of 2018. I did outbound calls for late-stage accounts that
              were set to be "charged-off" within the next month or so.

              Education at Work - Workforce Real-Time Analyst:
              I began working as a WFM RTA for EAW in August of 2018 and am
              currently employed in this position. I process attendance,
              one-time schedule changes, and real-time metrics on the Discover
              dialer.
