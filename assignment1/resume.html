              I worked at a Foam manufacturing plant for several months in 2014
              as a summer job. My duties included running several smaller
              machines that sealed open-celled foam, running a die-cutter, and
              packaging smaller deliveries. I also helped to re-organize the
              shipping an recieving section of the warehouse.

              I worked for EAW on behalf of Venmo for 6 months starting in
              December of 2017. I did email support and the majority of the
              tickets I would recive would concern MFA issues, adding bank
              accounts, and the status of delayed payments.

                I worked for EAW on behalf of Discover for 3 months starting in
                June of 2018. I did outbound calls for late-stage accounts that
                were set to be "charged-off" within the next month or so.
